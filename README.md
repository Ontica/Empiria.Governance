# About Empiria Governance

[Empiria Governance](http://www.ontica.org/) is our software library framework to build Governance and Compliance Management Solutions for the public and private sectors.

The project is based on C# 6.0 and .NET Framework 4.6, and the web API is tailored on ASP .NET Web API 2.2.

As other Empiria products, this backend runs over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions)
and uses [Empiria Steps](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Steps) for workflow and project management support.

The project can be compiled using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
